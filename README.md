## Concept
A text-based approach to drum sequencing, with a focus on *visual* rhythmic sequences.


## Devices


### MIDI sequencer

The MIDI sequencer can send MIDI messages to an external software such as Hydrogen.

The patterns are laid down in simple text within a dictionary structure.


```python
>>> from vjpy import VjPyDevice
>>> vjpd = VjPyDevice()
>>> md = vjpd.midi_device
>>> md.play_patterns(patterns)
```

### Pattern example
```python
patterns = {
    "01":
        {
            #      1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
            "h": ["x", "x", "x", "x", "x", "_", "x", "_"], # hi-hat
            "k": ["x", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_"], # kick
            "c": ["_", "_", "_", "_", "x", "_", "_", "_"]  # clap
        }
```

### Drumkit example 

A drumkit features drums. Each Drum is accesible by name, MIDI note, a shorthand and an emoji.

```python

"myfunkkit": Drumkit(
    name="myfunkkit",
    drums={
        "kick1": Drum(name="kick1", note=36, short_hand="k", emoji="ü•æ"),
        "clap1": Drum(name="clap1", note=40, short_hand="c", emoji="üëè"),
        "hat1": Drum(name="hat1", note=44, short_hand="h", emoji="üîî")
        }
    )
```

The MIDI device can also read and play MIDI files.


### Hydrogen MIDI file (modus SMF0)

```python
MD = VJPD.midi_device                               # device
MID_NAME = "drum_beat.mid")                         # file
mid = mido.MidiFile(MID_NAME, clip=True)            # object
track = mid.tracks[0]                               # track

meta_messages = [msg for msg in track[:4]]          # meta messages
copyright_ = meta_messages[0]                           # copyright
track_name = meta_messages[1]                           # name
tempo = meta_messages[2]                                # tempo
time_signature = meta_messages[3]                       # signature

messages = [msg for msg in track[4:-1]]             # messages
msg = messages[0]
m_type = msg.type                                       # type ('note on', 'note off')
m_note = msg.note                                       # note (int)
m_time = msg.time                                       # time (int)
m_velo = msg.velocity                                   # velocity (int)
```


### Audio device

The audio device can read, write, concatenate and mix audio files.

```python

# wav concatenation
wav_list = ["clap.wav", "kick.wav", "hat.wav"]
wav_concat = wv.concatenate_wavs(wav_list)

```

This function will merge these three wav files into a single one.


```python

# wav mixing
wav_list = ["clap.wav", "kick.wav", "hat.wav"]
wav_mixed = wv.mix_wavs(wav_list)

```

This function will 'add' or mix the three wavs together.


```python

Pattern audio rendering

patterns = {
    "01":
        {
            #      1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
            "k": ["x", "_", "_", "_", "x", "x", "x", "_"], # kick
            "h": ["x", "x", "x", "x", "x", "x", "_", "x"], # hi-hat
            "s": ["_", "_", "x", "_", "_", "_", "_", "x"]  # snare
            }
        }

rendered_pattern = wv.mix_wav_patterns(patterns)
```

This function will take a pattern and render the corresponding sounds into a single mixed and concatenated audio file.



## Video sounbank structure
```
soundbank name: "drums_01"

|soundbanks             # soundbanks directory
|_ drums_01             # soundbank directory
  |_ drums_01.mp4       # source video file
  |_ drums_01.mp3       # audio-only .mp3 file
  |_ drums_01.wav       # audio-only .wav file
  |_ drums_01.aup3      # audacity project file
  |_ drums_01.osp       # openshot project file
    |_ drums_01_assets  # openshot project assets
  |_ beats              # videobeats directory
    |_ beat_01.mp4      # videobeat file
```

## Glossary

### sample rate
The sampling frequency or sampling rate, fs, is the number of samples divided by the interval length over in which occur, thus fs = 1/T, with the unit sample per second, sometimes referred to as hertz, for example e.g. 48 kHz is 48,000 samples per second.

### Hz
The hertz (symbol: Hz) is the unit of frequency in the International System of Units, equivalent to one cycle per second

### amplitude
In a standing wave, the amplitude of vibration has nulls at some positions where the wave amplitude appears smaller or even zero.


## How to create a new video sound bank

- Record video clips hitting drums.
- Slice the video clips in a video editing software (one video per sound)
- If the sound bank has several clips, load them all into the time line
- Merge, edit, condense and separate the audio
- Clean the audio in an audio software
- Volume, normalization, high-pass, low-pass accordingly
- Re-import video+audio for further processing
- Set the starting frames to a point where the sound is at its peak
- Load the video file into a video object and use it to sequence videobeats
