# Glossary

### sample rate
The sampling frequency or sampling rate, fs, is the number of samples divided by the interval length over in which occur, thus fs = 1/T, with the unit sample per second, sometimes referred to as hertz, for example e.g. 48 kHz is 48,000 samples per second.

### Hz
The hertz (symbol: Hz) is the unit of frequency in the International System of Units, equivalent to one cycle per second

### amplitude
In a standing wave, the amplitude of vibration has nulls at some positions where the wave amplitude appears smaller or even zero.
